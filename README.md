Project Title:

“People Analytics: GenZ Career Aspirations Dashboard (Excel)”

According to survey design best practices, asking the right questions is crucial for extracting useful insights (as one source notes, "the better the questions — qual or quant — the better the content or insights" we can get from respondents). I applied this principle when crafting a detailed career-aspirations survey, which collected ~3,900 responses from working professionals. I then cleaned and transformed the raw data (handling missing values, standardizing formats, etc.) to prepare it for analysis. 

Overview (Data Collection & Preparation):

• Survey Design & Distribution: Crafted a 29-question career-aspirations survey covering demographics (timestamp, country, ZIP code, gender), influencers on career choice, education plans, work-environment preferences, company-mission alignment, team-size preferences, salary expectations, and key happiness/frustration factors. Deployed it across diverse channels, gathering 3,923 responses between December 2022 and January 2025.
• Data Cleaning & Transformation: Consolidated and standardized raw data—parsed timestamps, normalized ZIP codes, handled missing values (especially in free-text “Other” responses), and encoded categorical fields. Prepared a single “Responses” sheet for analysis and pivoting.

Analysis & Dashboard Development:

• PivotTable Engineering: Built a dedicated “Pivot” sheet with multiple PivotTables to calculate counts and percentages for each question, segmented by gender and geography.
• Interactive Dashboard: On the “Dashboard” sheet, linked PivotTables to charts and slicers—enabling dynamic filtering by gender, country, or salary range. Implemented:

Bar Charts for top-influencer rankings, preferred work environments, team-size choices, and frustration drivers.

Stacked Column Chart for salary-expectation distribution across ranges (₹5k–10k up to ₹50k+).

Donut/Pie Charts for binary questions (e.g., higher-education plans, mission-alignment willingness).

Slicers for on-the-fly segmentation (gender, country).

Key Insights Uncovered:

Family & Role Models Lead: “My Parents” (1,348 votes) and “Inspirational Leaders” (873 votes) topped the list of career influencers.

Flex‐Work Is King: Over 70% of respondents prefer hybrid or fully remote arrangements—underscoring the shift toward flexibility.

High Salary Aspirations: The majority expect ₹40–50 k or higher per month in their first role, reflecting evolving compensation expectations among early-career professionals.

Values-Driven Decisions: 75%+ would refuse roles misaligned with their personal mission—highlighting the power of purpose in talent attraction.

Skills & Tools Demonstrated:

End-to-End Project Leadership: From survey conception through data-collection logistics, cleansing, analysis, and stakeholder-ready presentation.

Advanced Excel Mastery: Expert use of PivotTables, dynamic PivotCharts, slicers, custom formatting, and formula-driven KPIs.

Data Storytelling & Visualization: Transformed complex survey data into an intuitive, interactive dashboard—enabling business partners to explore workforce insights on the fly.

Impact & Takeaway:

This project not only sharpened my data wrangling and visualization expertise but also delivered actionable HR analytics—illuminating how career motivations, work preferences, and value alignment converge to shape today’s talent landscape.
