GenZ Career Aspirations

People Analytics: GenZ Career Aspirations Dashboard (Excel)

Asking the right questions is key to insight quality. I applied this when crafting a 29-question career-aspirations survey (~3.9K responses). I then cleaned and transformed raw data (handling missing values, standardizing formats, etc.) for analysis.

Overview (Data Collection & Preparation):

• Survey Design & Distribution: Covered demographics (timestamp, country, ZIP, gender), career influencers, education plans, work preferences, company-mission alignment, team-size, salary expectations, and key happiness/frustration drivers. Collected 3,923 responses (Dec 2022–Jan 2025).

• Data Cleaning & Transformation: Parsed timestamps, normalized ZIPs, handled missing values (especially in “Other” fields), encoded categories, and created a single “Responses” sheet for analysis.

Analysis & Dashboard Development:

• PivotTable Engineering: Built a “Pivot” sheet with multiple PivotTables showing counts and %s by gender and geography.

• Interactive Dashboard: Linked PivotTables to charts and slicers on the “Dashboard” sheet for filtering by gender, country, or salary. Implemented:

– Bar Charts: Influencers, work environment, team-size, frustration drivers
– Stacked Column: Salary-expectation ranges (₹5k–₹50k+)
– Donut/Pie: Binary questions (e.g., higher-ed plans, mission alignment)
– Slicers: Gender, country

Key Insights Uncovered:

• Family & Leaders Lead: “My Parents” (1,348) and “Inspirational Leaders” (873) were top career influencers.
• Flexibility First: 70%+ prefer hybrid or remote work.
• Rising Pay Goals: Most expect ₹40–50k+ in first role.
• Purpose Over Pay: 75%+ would decline misaligned jobs.

Skills & Tools Demonstrated:

• End-to-End Execution: From survey design to data prep, analysis, and delivery.
• Advanced Excel: PivotTables, charts, slicers, custom formatting, formula-driven KPIs.
• Data Storytelling: Translated survey data into a clear, interactive dashboard.

Impact:

Sharpened my data and visualization skills while delivering actionable GenZ career insights for HR and workforce planning.
